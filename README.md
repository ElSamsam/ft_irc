#ft_irc
** **
A lightweight IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server implemented in **C++98**, built as part of the 42 school curriculum. 

It aims to be compatible with real IRC clients (i.e.: `hexchat` or `nc`) while serving as a learning project for socket programming, non-blocking I/O, and the IRC protocol.
